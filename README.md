# Your Next Clue

In the backyard, where the sun does gleam
Nature's canvas, a tranquil, soothing sight
In the backyard, where the sun does gleam
Underneath the sky's vast azure theme
A sanctuary, where day turns into night

A broom's soft whispers sweep the floor,
Gently, it tidies, then sweeps no more.

Beneath the broom, dust bunnies hide,
In the corners, where they quietly reside.
